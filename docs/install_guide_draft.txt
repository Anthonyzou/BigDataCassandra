Section 0: Warnings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    -Do not try to configure a cluster unless you have been authorized by
     your local system administrator.
    -Do not configure a cluster on a system that is intended to do many
     other things.
    -Do not authorize untrustworthy third parties to modify data on your
     cluster.
    -Do not attempt to follow this guide with older versions of the
     software mentioned, as major configuration and operation details can
     vary significantly between releases, no matter how minor.

Section 1: Hardware Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    -32TB of readable and writable disk space, spread over at least 8 
     separate servers with a minimum of 4TB of disk space each. These will
     form the "nodes" of the cluster.
    -

Section 2: System Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    -Any reasonably current version of at least one of the following: 
     UNIX, UNIX-variant operating system or GNU+Linux distribution; 
     Microsoft Windows 7 or 8; Mac OSX.

    -Apache Cassandra ver. 2.0.6 (or later). Installation instructions below.
    -Apache cql ver. 3.1.5 (or later). Installation instructions below.

Section 3: Installation Instructions (Using Cassandra 2.06)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Installing the Python Driver:
    sudo pip install cassandra-driver

Getting Cassandra
    On Debian-Based GNU+Linux:
        $> sudo apt-get install cassandra-2.0.6.yourarch

    On RHEL/CentOS/Fedora GNU+Linux:
        $> su yum install cassandra-2.0.6.yourarch

    On Arch Linux:
        ???? pacman?

    From Source (UNIX-Like):
        -Option 1) Use your package manager to install Apache Cassandra
                   for you. If Cassandra 2.0.6 is not available, or if
                   you do not have a package manager, then go to option 2.
        -Option 2) Install from source:
            -Download source from Apache Project's Cassandra repository.
            -Save source files in the directory which you wish to install
             them in. This wil probably require superuser privileges.
            -Follow the `make` instructions in the README.

    On Microsoft Windows 8:
        ????

    On Microsoft Windows 7:
        ????

    On Microsoft Windows (Prior to Win7):
        ????

    
Getting cql 3.1.1:
    On Debian-Based GNU+Linux:
        $> sudo apt-get install cassandra-2.0.6.yourarch

    On RHEL/CentOS/Fedora GNU+Linux:
        $> su yum install cassandra-2.0.6.yourarch


Configuring Cassandra with the .yaml File
    First go into our projects source directory,
        $> cd /some/path/.../CMPUT391/misc
    Then overwrite the default configuration file for cassandra with ours:
        $> sudo cp ./cassandra.yaml /etc/cassandra/default.conf/cassandra.yaml
    Change the listen_address to 10.0.0.xx

Configuring the Cluster:
    -The cluster name must be "group3".
    -The listen_adress must be set appropriately.
    -In the source directory of Cassandra: cassandra/bin
        $> cd /some/path/name/.../cassandra/bin
        $> cqlsh
        !> CREATE KEYSPACE group3 
        ... WITH REPLICATION = 
        ... { 'class' : 'SimpleStrategy', 'replication_factor' : 1 };
        !> exit

Getting our source:
    -git clone 

Subsection 3.4: Running Cassandra for the First Time
    Two Options:
        1) At a shell prompt:
            $> sudo cassandra &
                . [cqlsh or Cassandra]
                . [activity takes place]
                . [at this time]
            $> sudo pkill cassandra

            In the shell you call Cassandra from, unless you specify
            a quiet option you will probably see a lot of startup 
            information printed in the terminal.

        2) Optional: create your own alias(es) in your .bash or equivalent shell
           configuration file for the above commands, such as `startcass`
           and `stopcass`, etc., or whatever you like.

Subsection 3.5: Running cqlsh for the First Time
    Move to the folder containing cassandra, OR the folder containing
    Cassandra to your $PATH variable.
    ./cassandra

    While Cassandra is already running (see above subsection):
        $> cqlsh
    
    This will run the cql interpreter. You should have Cassandra running
    for this to do anything with the cluster you have set up.

    To exit cqlsh:
        !> exit

    Make sure to kill any running instances of Cassandra before you
    exit your user session on the server. In general, if you are not
    pressed for time, exit Cassandra whenever you are about to leave the
    workstation or terminate your remote session, lock your session, etc.,
    so that you do not (accidentally) choke the system's resources, or
    leave processes running when you are gone.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Subsection 8.1: Connection Problems
    -Cassandra will not start:
        -Make sure that you have the privileges required to run Cassandra.
            -Are you in the sudoers file (or your system's equivalent)?
             This guide assumes that you have some level of elevated privilege
             close to that of sysadmin.
            -Did you invoke Cassandra while your sysadmin privileges are
             enabled? i.e., did you forget to start cassandra with `su' or
             `sudo', or your system's equivalent?
            -Are you invoking an executable file of Cassandra from a folder
             where you have the applicable privileges?

        -Make sure that Cassandra is properly configured. If you are worried
         that your system's cassandra.yaml has been broken in some way, you
         can always copy the .yaml from this projects source into your
         /etc/cassandra/default.conf/ directory to replace the old
         cassandra.yaml file.

        -Make sure that if you are trying to run Cassandra on the local
         machine that it is willing to accept requests from the local host,
         which will almost always be 127.0.0.1.
         Open your cassandra.yaml file in /etc/cassandra/default.conf in your
         favorite text editor. (Note: you will need sysadmin privileges to
         write any changes) Then search for the section beginning with
         `seed_provider:'. Below the indented `- class_name:' line there will 
         be another line at a deeper indentation called `- seeds:'. In the
         double-quoted string there should be at least one shortened IP
         address that is exactly `127.0.0.1' (the local 'loopback' address).
         If that address is not listed, add it and separate it from any 
         other IP addresses by a comma if necessary. This will not be necessary
         if it is the only address between the double-quotes.
         Save your change and immediately close the file. Depening on your 
         system, you might need to do a soft-reset, but only try that if trying
         to start Cassandra results in the same error.

        -If none of the above steps work, make sure that Cassandra's storage
         is properly set up.

    -cqlsh will not start:
        -Cassandra may not be configured to accept connections from
         the localhost (127.0.0.1). 
         See the configuration file: /etc/cassandra/default.conf/cassandra.yaml

    -You cannot connect to your server remotely.
        -Check your known hosts file: ~/.ssh/known_hosts
        -Make sure that you have configured you ssh keys.
