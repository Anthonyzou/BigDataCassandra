1.) Which system did you decide to use?
        -Apache Cassandra version 2.0.5.

2.) How did you choose it, by making simple simple experiments or reading some
    documents?
        -The initial decision to explore the possibilty of utilizing 
         Apache Projects Cassandra was initially based upon knowledge of its
         utility in many popular online content aggregators, such as Reddit.
         Because of its efficient implementation of map-reduce algorithms and
         ease of use with respect to configuration of clusters, as well as its
         maintenance capabilities (automated cleaning and organizing of 
         storage space in nodes -- see "The Write Path to Compaction"), we 
         chose it as our "system". 
         Other advantages of using Cassandra include:
            -Relatively small size of installation on disk for core components;
            -Simple, straightforward and well documented configuration: most
             of the setup can be done quickly and easily via any GNU+Linux,
             UNIX or UNIX-Like OS implementation of a bash command interpreter;
            -Cassandra includes a fully functioning shell (interpreter) of its
             own;
            -The Apache Cassandra development community supports integration of
             many different programming languages into both the code base of
             Cassandra itself, and into independent projects, such as this
             one;
            -Besides running without any issues on most GNU+Linux distributions
             and UNIX-Like OSes, Apache Cassandra has also been successfully
             ported to most (modern) Microsoft Windows operating systems.
             This is especially well-suited to meet the needs of our team for
             this project, due to our differing levels of experience with
             different families of operating systems, and/or GNU+Linux
             distributions (RHEL v.s. Debian Linux, GNU+Linux v.s. Windows, etc);
            -Cassandra is licenced as FOSS (Free and Open Source Software),
             and while copies of it can be sold, potentially for profit to
             its developers or the Apache Foundation, viewing or modification
             of its source code is neither forbidden nor discouraged. This
             creates an excellent opportunity for our team to further explore
             how its core functionality is implemented with no risk of any
             legal rammifications.
        -Our choice of Cassandra was mostly based upon some initial experiments
         coupled with curiosity about the high-level approach to managing the
         "problem of Big Data". We needed to find a convenient and especially
         portable mechanism for implementing, testing and demonstrating our
         project without incurring any financial losses, or losing too much
         time trying to implement complex Map-Reduce algorithms incorrectly
         or inefficiently. Instead, it is now possible to gather experimental
         data about the efficiency of certain queries in the context of our
         Big Data application in an accurate and reliable manner. 
         
         To sum up: By choosing to use Cassandra, our team can focus on how 
         to best utilize all of the nodes of our cluster in a more general 
         fashion to measure how to most effectively organize and query large 
         collections of information.
